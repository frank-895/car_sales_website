		<h3>How does <ins>oil</ins> work and why is <ins>coolant</ins> important for your vehicle?</h3>

		<div class="quinndiv">
			<p><h4><i>Oil</i></h4> generally works by clinging to metallic surfaces which slide over each other inside your engine and other car parts, such as
			the steering shaft, wheel bearings, gearbox and so on. <br>
			<br>
			This makes the parts slide over each other with less friction, therefore generating less waste heat, resistance and wear and tear
			on the parts.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Without <u>sufficient lubrication</u>, your vehicle will quickly deteriorate in condition and will likely <var>break down.</var></p>

		<div class="quinndiv">
			<p><h4><i>Coolant</i></h4> is a liquid, usually water with some additives to prevent the water from freezing, boiling or becoming contaminated with biological growth.
				<br>
				<br>
				This liquid runs through your engine, warming up and taking the heat away from the engine block. The coolant then is pumped
				through the radiator in the front of your car, which receives cold air from outside and is also fed by a fan. This cools the liquid, which is then
				sent back through the engine to dissipate more heat.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>It is crucial to check your coolant regularly to ensure a leak-free system and a good condition of the coolant itself.
				Without a <u>well-functioning</u> cooling system for your engine, your car will quickly overheat and will also likely <var>break down.</var>
